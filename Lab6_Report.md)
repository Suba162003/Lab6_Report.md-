# Lab 6: NAT Configuration

## Objective
To configure Network Address Translation (NAT) for facilitating communication between internal and external networks.

## Materials Required
- Packet Tracer software

## Theory
### Overview of NAT
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used to modify the IP address information in packet headers while in transit across a routing device. It allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet. NAT is important for conserving public IP addresses and enhancing security by obscuring internal network structures.

## Procedure
1. **Create a Network**:
   - Design a network topology consisting of:
     - An internal segment (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
     - An external segment with a public IP (e.g., `203.0.113.1`)

2. **Configure NAT on the Router**:
   - Access the CLI of the router connecting the internal and external segments.
   - Configure NAT by following these steps:
     ```bash
     enable
     configure terminal
     
     # Define the internal network
     interface g0/0
     ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
     ip nat inside
     no shutdown
     
     # Define the external interface
     interface g0/1
     ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0
     ip nat outside
     no shutdown
     
     # Configure NAT to translate internal addresses to the external IP
     ip nat inside source list 1 interface g0/1 overload

     # Define access list for NAT
     access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
     exit
     ```

3. **Test Connectivity**:
   - From a PC in the internal network (e.g., `192.168.1.10`), try to ping an external IP (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).
   - Use a traceroute command to check the path to the external IP.

## Observations
- **NAT Configuration Steps**:
  - Documented the configuration commands used to set up NAT on the router.
  - Noted the configuration of internal and external interfaces.

- **Test Results**:
  - The internal PC successfully pinged the external IP, confirming that NAT was functioning correctly.

## Conclusion
This lab highlighted the effectiveness of Network Address Translation (NAT) in managing IP address utilization and enhancing security. By allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address, NAT conserves valuable address space and helps protect the internal network from direct exposure to external threats. Understanding and configuring NAT is essential for modern networking.
